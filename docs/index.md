## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

**PrometheusEval** is a powerful Python package designed to facilitate the evaluation and grading of AI-generated responses using Prometheus. It provides a set of tools and utilities that allow users to assess the quality of responses based on predefined criteria and rubrics. The package supports both absolute and relative grading schemes, enabling users to evaluate responses individually or in comparison to each other.

PrometheusEval leverages the capabilities of Prometheus to generate high-quality evaluations and feedback. It offers a user-friendly interface for defining grading templates, rubrics, and evaluation criteria. The package also includes built-in functionality for handling large datasets and performing batch processing, making it suitable for evaluating responses at scale.

### 1.2. Key Features

- Absolute Grading: PrometheusEval allows users to grade responses individually based on predefined criteria and rubrics. It provides a set of templates and utilities for defining grading schemes and generating detailed feedback for each response.

- Relative Grading: The package supports relative grading, enabling users to compare and evaluate responses against each other. This feature is particularly useful when assessing the quality of responses in a comparative context.

- Customizable Templates: PrometheusEval offers a flexible templating system that allows users to define their own grading templates and rubrics. Users can easily customize the evaluation criteria and scoring scales to suit their specific requirements.

- Batch Processing: The package includes built-in functionality for processing large datasets efficiently. It supports batch grading, allowing users to evaluate multiple responses simultaneously, saving time and computational resources.

- Detailed Feedback: The package generates detailed feedback for each evaluated response, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the generated text. This feedback can be used to improve the quality of AI-generated responses and guide further development.

Whether you are a researcher, developer, or data scientist working with AI-generated text, PrometheusEval provides a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating and grading responses efficiently and effectively. With its powerful features and intuitive interface, PrometheusEval streamlines the evaluation process and helps users gain valuable insights into the quality of AI-generated content.
