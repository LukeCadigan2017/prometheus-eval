### Custom Data Evaluation

*Note*: Custom data evaluation will be available in the next release. Stay tuned!

If you have a custom dataset that you would like to evaluate using Prometheus and prepared in correct format, you can use the `eval` directory to evaluate your data. The `run_direct_assessment.py` and `run_pairwise_ranking.py` scripts can be used to evaluate direct assessment and pairwise ranking data, respectively.
