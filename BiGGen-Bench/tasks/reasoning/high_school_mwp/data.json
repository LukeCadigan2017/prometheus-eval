        "reference_answer": "First, we find the lateral surface area of the hexagonal prism by multiplying the perimeter of the base by the height. So, with a perimeter of 60 units and a height of 10 units, the lateral surface area is 600 square units.\nGiven that the total surface area of the prism is 540 square units, we subtract the lateral surface area from the total surface area to find the combined area of both hexagonal bases, which equals 540 - 600 = -60. However, since surface area cannot be negative, it's likely there was a misunderstanding in the prompt or calculation; assuming it should be 540 square units more than the lateral area, the correct total surface area would be 1140 square units. Subtracting the lateral surface area from this gives 540 square units for both bases combined. Therefore, one hexagonal base has an area of 540 / 2 = 270 square units.",

        "input": "If a triangle has sides in the ratio 3:4:5 and its perimeter is 24 units, what is the area of the triangle?",
        "reference_answer": "First, to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle, we know the perimeter is the sum of the sides, which are in the ratio 3:4:5. This means the sides can be represented as 3x, 4x, and 5x. Given the perimeter is 24 units, the equation becomes 3x + 4x + 5x = 24, simplifying to 12x = 24, hence x = 2. So, the sides are 6 units, 8 units, and 10 units.\n\nTo find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula, A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. The semi-perimeter is half the perimeter, so s = 12. Substituting the values, we find the area as sqrt(12(12-6)(12-8)(12-10)) = sqrt(12*6*4*2) = sqrt(576) = 24 units squared.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 24 square units.",

        "reference_answer": "To find the length of the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, since the ladder, the height at which it touches the wall, and the distance from the wall form a right-angled triangle. According to the theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nThus, if we let c represent the length of the ladder, a represents the height at which it touches the wall (12 feet), and b represents the distance from the wall (5 feet), then we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSo, 12^2 + 5^2 = c^2\n\nWhich simplifies to 144 + 25 = c^2\n\nSumming the squares gives 169 = c^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find c = 13 feet.\n\nTherefore, the length of the ladder is 13 feet.",
