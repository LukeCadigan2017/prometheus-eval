Conclusion: Therefore, flights are canceled.\n\n**Validity Assessment**:\nThe argument follows a logical form called modus ponens, which states: if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. Here, P is \"there\u2019s a rainbow\", and Q is \"flights get canceled\". The argument correctly follows this form: it is claimed that if there is a rainbow (P), then flights get canceled (Q); and it is stated that there is a rainbow (P). Therefore, following the form of modus ponens, the conclusion that flights are canceled (Q) is correctly derived from the premises. This makes the argument valid.\n\n**Soundness Assessment**:\nFor the argument to be sound, both premises must be true. The first premise \"If there\u2019s a rainbow, flights get canceled\" is a questionable statement. This premise seems highly unlikely to be true, as the occurrence of rainbows is not a standard or logical reason for flight cancellations. Rainbows are a common meteorological phenomenon that doesn't generally affect aviation. The second premise \"There is a rainbow now\" could be true, but it depends on the specific situation.\n\nSince the first premise is likely false, the argument, despite being valid, is not sound. A sound argument requires both logical structure (validity) and true premises, which is not the case here.",

This logic is flawed, as there are numerous devices, such as tablets, smartwatches, and laptops, that can also access the internet. The argument takes the form 'If P then Q, Q is true, therefore P is true,' which is a recognized logical error because the 'Q' condition (internet access) does not exclusively imply 'P' (being a smartphone).\n\nTherefore, while the premises regarding internet access might be true, the argument fails in its validity due to the fallacious reasoning.
