This gives us 5a - 7 = 5b - 7. Solving for a and b, we find a = b. Thus, f is injective because it assigns distinctly different real numbers to distinct values of x. \n\nNext, to prove surjectivity, let y be any element in R. We need to find an x such that f(x) = y. Starting with f(x) = 5x - 7 = y, solving for x gives x = (y + 7)/5. Since both y and 7 are real, and the division of two real numbers is real, x is in R. Hence, for every y in R, there exists an x in R such that f(x) = y, proving surjectivity. \n\nSince f is both injective and surjective, we conclude f is bijective, as needed.",
