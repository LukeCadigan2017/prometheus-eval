Then, J > M > C \u2265 1, such that J + M + C = 100.\n\nIf we convert J = J'+1, M = M'+1, C = C'+1, the condition could be rewritten as J' + M' + C' = 97 and J' > M' > C' \u2265 0.\n\nThen, we could consider this problem as a partitioning problem of distributing 97 tickets to John, Mary, and Caleb. The distribution needs to ensure no two people get an equal number of tickets beyond the first, which is guaranteed to each.\n\nWe start by using the 'stars and bars' method, which is a common combinatorial technique to distribution n identical items into k distinct bins. Applying the formula \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!}, the number of distributing 97 tickets among 3 people (without considering strict inequality) would be \frac{(97+3-1)!}{97!2!} = \frac{99 \\times 98}{2} = 99 \\times 49 = 4851.\n\nNow, we should subtract the cases where at least two numbers among J, M, C are identical to ensure strict inequality.\n\nSince 97 is not divided by 3, we can only consider when either J = M, M = C, or J = C. For example, when J = M, we can convert the equation J' + M' + C' = 97 into 2 \\times J' + C' = 97. Since C' is always an odd number, we could rewrite it into C' = 2 \\times C'' + 1 and 2 \\times (J' + C'') + 1 = 97. Then, the equation could be expressed as J' + C'' = 48. If we apply the formula \binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = \frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!} once more, the result is \frac{(48+2-1)!}{48!1!} = 49.\n\nThis holds for cases when M = C or J = C as well, and each cases are mutually exclusive.\n\nHence, the final answer should be subtracting 49 \\times 3 from the total number of cases that does not consider strict inequality and dividing into 3! so that the strict inequality is satisfied. So, the answer is \frac{4851 - 49 \\times 3}{3!} = \frac{4851 - 147}{6} = \frac{4704}{6} = 784.",

Thus, the height (h) is 3 units.\n\nNext, we apply the formula for the volume of a cone, V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h.
