Phonologically, one of the most notable developments is the Great Vowel Shift, which dramatically altered vowel pronunciation from the 15th to 18th centuries and played a crucial role in differentiating Middle English from Modern English pronunciation. Grammatically, English underwent considerable simplification; for instance, the gender system of Old English, where nouns were masculine, feminine, or neutral, was replaced by a primarily non-gendered system. Moreover, the grammar became less inflectional, with a decrease in case endings for nouns and adjectives. In terms of vocabulary, the influence of Norman French post the Norman Conquest in 1066 introduced a vast number of Loanwords, expanding English lexicon, especially in areas like law, art, and cuisine. Additionally, the advent of the printing press in the 15th century standardized spelling and grammar, further distinguishing Modern English.
