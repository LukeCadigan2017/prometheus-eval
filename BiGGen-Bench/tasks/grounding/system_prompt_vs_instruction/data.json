The teen was one of 19 victims -- children and young women -- in one of the most gruesome serial killings in India in recent years. The Allahabad high court has acquitted Moninder Singh Pandher, his lawyer Sikandar B. Kochar told CNN. Pandher and his domestic employee Surinder Koli were sentenced to death in February by a lower court for the rape and murder of the 14-year-old. The high court upheld Koli's death sentence, Kochar said. The two were arrested two years ago after body parts packed in plastic bags were found near their home in Noida, a New Delhi suburb. Their home was later dubbed a \"house of horrors\" by the Indian media. Pandher was not named a main suspect by investigators initially, but was summoned as co-accused during the trial, Kochar said. Kochar said his client was in Australia when the teen was raped and killed. Pandher faces trial in the remaining 18 killings and could remain in custody, the attorney said.\nQuestion: What was the amount of children murdered?",

The teen was one of the 19 victims, which included children and young adults, who had been brutally killed, making it one of India's most horrific serial killings in recent memory. Despite the acquittal, Pandher's domestic employee, Surinder Koli, had his death sentence upheld. The two were arrested after body parts in plastic bags were discovered near their home in a suburb of New Delhi.

By optimizing routes with AI, these vehicles could decrease travel times and environmental impact, contributing to a more sustainable future. However, this technological advance comes with substantial challenges. The shift could lead to substantial job losses among professional drivers, necessitating policies for workforce transition and retraining. Ethical concerns regarding AI's decision-making in critical scenarios need to be addressed to ensure public trust in autonomous systems. Additionally, the increased reliance on connected technology raises cybersecurity concerns, highlighting the need for robust security protocols to protect against hacking and preserve user privacy. Overall, while the benefits are considerable, a careful approach is required to mitigate the drawbacks and ensure that the transition to autonomous vehicles benefits society as a whole.",
