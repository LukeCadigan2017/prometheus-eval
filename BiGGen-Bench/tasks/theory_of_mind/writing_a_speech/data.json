        "reference_answer": "Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nWelcome to a journey through the vertical farms of tomorrow, a journey that reimagines not just how we grow our food but also how we sustain our urban ecosystems.\n\n**Unveiling Vertical Farming**\n\nVertical farming, in its essence, is the art of growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in controlled environments. It's a concept that's rapidly gaining traction as we grapple with the challenges of urbanization, dwindling arable land, and the urgent need for sustainable living practices.\n\n**The Mechanics Behind the Greens**\n\nImagine layers upon layers of lush greenery, not spread across sprawling fields, but soaring upwards in the heart of the city. This is achieved through a blend of hydroponics \u2013 plants thriving in nutrient-rich water, sans soil \u2013 and aeroponics, where roots receive a nourishing mist. These techniques are married with cutting-edge technology: energy-efficient LED lighting, automated systems for planting and harvesting, and climate control mechanisms to create the perfect growing conditions year-round.\n\n**Revolutionizing Urban Landscapes**\n\nNow, let's delve into the profound impact of vertical farming on urban sustainability. In cities where space is at a premium, vertical farms turn underutilized buildings into verdant food-producing hubs. This space efficiency is a game-changer, enabling us to grow an abundance of food in a fraction of the area required by traditional farms.\n\nBut the benefits don't stop there. Vertical farms are paragons of resource conservation. They use up to 90% less water than conventional farming \u2013 a vital consideration as water scarcity becomes an increasingly pressing global issue. These farms also bypass the need for vast expanses of arable land, circumventing soil erosion and degradation.\n\n**A Beacon of Sustainability**\n\nVertical farming is more than just an agricultural innovation; it's a cornerstone of sustainable urban development. By localizing food production, it slashes 'food miles', significantly cutting down the carbon emissions associated with transportation. This local approach not only reduces greenhouse gases but also fortifies city resilience by providing a steady supply of fresh, nutritious produce, irrespective of external supply chain disruptions.\n\n**Facing Challenges Head-On**\n\nYes, the path of vertical farming is strewn with hurdles \u2013 the capital intensity, the energy demands, the steep learning curve of managing these high-tech systems. But the future is bright and promising. As renewable energy becomes more accessible and AI technology more advanced, these farms will evolve into more energy-efficient and cost-effective systems.\n\n**Envisioning Tomorrow**\n\nImagine, if you will, cities of the future where vertical farms are not just food sources but integral elements of the urban fabric \u2013 contributing to the well-being of communities, enhancing biodiversity, and teaching future generations about the importance of sustainable living.\n\n**In Closing**\n\nIn this era of rapid urbanization and environmental consciousness, vertical farming isn't merely a solution; it's a revolution \u2013 a revolution that redefines our relationship with food, nature, and our urban landscapes. It's a vision of a world where sustainability isn't just a goal but a way of life.\n\nThank you.",

                "information": "Vertical farming offers many benefits that traditional farming cannot. For example, while the crops produced by traditional farming are limited by geographic region and seasonal changes, vertical farming allows growers to grow regional or seasonal crops indoors year-round. They can grow crops anywhere a greenhouse or controlled environment can be established. As a result, consumers (especially those in urban areas typically far from traditional farmlands) can also have easier access to fresher produce. Vertical farming also uses much less land.  For some crops, 10 to 20 times the yield can be obtained per acre in vertical farming compared to open-field crops. Other advantages are that vertical farms are in enclosed structures, so not subject to extreme or inclement weather.  Vertical farms are being built in deserts, high-population urban areas, and other places that traditional open-field farming is not practical. The major disadvantage is that you give up access to the Sun, which is most abundant (and free) source of energy on Earth. Growing plants vertically in stacked systems often requires artificial light sources, which can become costly. Vertical farming also requires humidity control through expensive and energy-intensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Another limitation is the general lack of knowledge and experience in maximizing crop productivity under a controlled environment. Vertical farming is an emerging technology. Although it is still a small market right now, it has tremendous growth potential as environment control, automation, and crop production technologies are improved and energy costs are reduced. It is hard to predict how this industry will grow in the future, but I believe that it's possible that vertical farming can take over approximately 50% of leafy green markets in the U.S. and some small portions (~5%) of small fruit (strawberry) and tomato markets in 10 years.",

                "information": "Technological advancements\nTechnology is ever-changing, and vertical farming is no exception to this. Advancements in the industry include automation, data analytics, advanced LED light systems, and even AI (artificial intelligence)!\n\nAutomation: With manual (or semi-automated) vertical farms, crops are typically grown on static multi-level racks and human labour is required for all essential processes.\n\nWith automation, the only human labour tasks required are for maintenance. For example, more and more automated farms have growing trays with plants that are automatically moved from zone to zone according to the crops' current growing cycle, reducing labour time significantly.\n\nThere's also focus on growers using energy-efficient solutions including the use of renewable energy sources, improved insulation, and energy-efficient HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.\n\nData analytics: By using data analytics with agriculture, farmers can enhance the efficiency of their resources and adjust factors like water usage, lighting schedule, nutrient mixing and temperature control in response to real-time data. Making real-time changes not only maximizes your investment but maximizes your harvest and ROI, too.\n\n(Did you know? Growcer's Osiris\u00ae modular farm features remote monitoring and control of your farm from anywhere.)\n\nAI: AI is gaining momentum, and vertical farming is no exception. Like another (super genius) team member, it can predict how (and how well) your crops are going to grow and spot potential diseases. What's really cool about it is being able to tweak nutrient levels or send in super-targeted treatments, meaning higher yields and healthier crops!\n\nHowever, getting back to basics is also a trend for 2024 after a few booms and busts in the vertical farming industry. Sometimes - depending on your operation - you're better off sticking to more traditional practices overseen by head growers to keep your production economics profitable. A discerning eye for technology advancements will help you see through the hype and focus on what will leave a meaningful impact to you and your plants.\n\nCustomized crop varieties\nMore and more, vertical farms are using and offering customized crop varieties. It allows growers to tailor their produce to meet customer preferences and market trends.\n\nHere's how they're doing it:\n\nMicrogreens and Specialty Crops: Vertical farms are well-suited for growing microgreens and specialty crops. These farms can experiment with various varieties to produce unique and exotic microgreens, herbs, and edible flowers that are in high demand among chefs and consumers looking for gourmet ingredients. It's all about knowing your customers - like cultivating a unique Japanese strawberry using vertical farms in North America.\n\nCustomization for Chefs and Restaurants: Vertical farms often collaborate with chefs and restaurants to grow crops that meet their exact specifications. Chefs can work directly with growers to select and develop varieties that match their customers' needs.\n\nBrand Differentiation: Offering unique crop varieties can help modular farms differentiate themselves in the market and build a strong brand based on innovation and quality. Brand your greens!\n\nShifting supply indoors\nWith climate change and weather affecting crop quality and availability, many growers and suppliers have chosen to shift their growing to greenhouses or modular, indoor farms. Of course, a major advantage to this is the ability to extend your growing season beyond traditional climate limits. \n\nIt's not a fringe trend either - late in 2023, popular burger chain Wendy's looked to move its lettuce supply to greenhouses because of climate change concerns. \n\nOther reasons why shifting indoors just makes sense:\n\nClimate control: regulate temperature, insulation, humidity, and light levels.\n\nReduced pests and disease: modular farms and greenhouses act as a barrier to many pests, ultimately reducing or eliminating the need for chemical pesticides.\n\nBetter water efficiency: Greenhouse systems use water-efficient solutions, but modular farms using hydroponic systems allow growers to produce food sustainably and quickly using less water.\n\nIncreased investments and funding\nA growing trend of investment in agriculture and agribusiness is largely driven by several factors, including the increased demand for local food, favourable investment returns, and reduced pricing volatility of the industry. An increased interest in funding local food projects, like Growcer's modular farms, is also what led to the creation of Growcer Finance late last year.\n\nGrowcer Finance is a program that matches aspiring growers with financing options and offers investment opportunities for accredited investors. Learn more about Growcer Finance.\n\nRetail Trends\nHyper-localization\nHyper-localization (or just \u201chyper-local food\u201d) means growing it close to where it is going to be consumed. The term \u201clocal\u201d itself is a broad term, but in this instance we're referring to hyper-local to mean the practice of growing food within the community that it will be sold and enjoyed.\n\nLocalizing food growth is efficient and more sustainable than traditional methods. \n\nGrowcer Story: New Horizon Co-op in northern Alberta partnered with Growcer in 2021 so they would have the ability to supply their co-op members with hyper-local greens year-round\u2014even in sub-zero temperatures. Their modular farm is located in the parking lot; it doesn't get more local than that! In as little as six weeks, growers can grow up to 800 heads of various  produce such as  lettuce, kale, spinach, and various herbs.\n\nFocus on sustainability\nUp until recently sustainability has been a \u201cnice-to-have,\u201d but that's about to change. According to research published in the Harvard Business Review, we're fast approaching this tipping point where sustainability will be considered a baseline requirement for purchase. This comes as no surprise as headlines around humans' impact on the environment and natural disasters grace our feeds with more frequency than before. \n\nThe research found \u201cwhen Gen Z and Millennial customers believe a brand cares about its impact on people and the planet, they are 27% more likely to purchase it than older generations are \u2014 a clear measure of sustainability's power to drive buying decisions in this group.\u201d As the buying power of younger generations grows, sustainability will remain a focus for consumers. \n\nVertical farming and sustainability go hand-in-hand. \n\nLocalized production means less transportation emissions\n\nHydroponic farming means less water and land use\n\nGrower education and community involvement through local vertical farming builds sustainable thriving communities \n\nGrowcer Story: Gitmaxmak'ay Nisga'a Society, a non-profit in one of the rainiest and cloudiest cities in Canada, saw an opportunity to use indoor hydroponic farming when they couldn't rely on traditional agriculture to increase food security. Now the community of 1,600 members gains access to fresh leafy vegetables weekly with a subscription box. Greens are also sold to local businesses and surplus is donated to community members in need.  \nOnline/omni-channel shopping\nPost-pandemic, more shoppers feel comfortable with online shopping than ever before. \n\nIf you're a vertical farming grower, you also are keenly aware that you can sell directly to customers for a higher price than what you can sell to grocery stores who would buy your products at wholesale prices. \n\nWe'll see a continuation of online and direct to consumer avenues (like subscription boxes) be one of the distribution channels for smaller vertical farms:\n\nOnline ordering platforms (e-commerce)\n\nOnline subscription services/co-op\n\nDigital marketing (social media, email newsletters)\n\nClick and collect services\n\nGrowcer story: Nipissing First Nation's (NFN) Mnogin Greenhouse grows a variety of fresh greens for the community of about 3,000 and nearby restaurants year-round. Chief McLeod shares that this venture is a unique opportunity for NFN members to get involved and also have their location serve as a training hub for First Nations who want to get into this type of business.

Today, I want to discuss a topic of paramount importance, often overlooked but immensely powerful - the power of your vote in local elections.\n\nMany of you might feel that politics is a distant, disconnected world, and your single vote is just a small, inconsequential drop in a vast ocean. However, I want to emphasize that in the realm of local governance, your vote transforms from a mere drop to a significant ripple that can bring about waves of change.\n\nThink about the environment you live in - the roads you travel, the schools that educate our children, and the parks where we relax and play. These aspects of our daily lives are directly shaped by the decisions made in local elections. When you cast your vote for local officials, you are actively choosing the people who will determine the use of your taxes, the quality of your children's education, and the efficiency of your local services. These are decisions that affect your daily life, decisions that warrant your involvement and your voice.\n\nAt this point, you might wonder, \u201cDoes my vote truly make a difference?\u201d History has shown us, especially in local elections where voter turnout is often low, that every single vote counts. A handful of votes can sway critical local issues or elections. When you choose not to vote, you're essentially allowing others to make decisions on your behalf, decisions that you live with every day.\n\nThis brings me to address the diverse demographic of our community \u2013 the energetic young adults with fresh ideas, the working professionals with invaluable experiences, and our respected seniors with decades of wisdom. Your participation in voting is not just a civic duty; it's a powerful statement of your aspirations for our community. Your vote is your voice in shaping the policies and services that impact our lives.\n\nLet's consider the collective power of our votes. When we step into the voting booth and cast our ballots, we're not just making a personal choice; we're voicing our collective hopes for the community. It's how we can influence tangible changes \u2013 better roads, improved schools, safer neighborhoods.\n\nTherefore, I urge each one of you to realize the potential of your vote. The next local election is not just another routine event; it's a crucial opportunity to shape the future of our community. Your vote is not just a right or a privilege; it's a catalyst for change, a tool to carve out the kind of community in which you wish to live. \n\nIn conclusion, let's not underestimate the power of our votes. It's time to embrace the responsibility and the opportunity that voting presents. Let's step into that voting booth not just as individuals, but as a united community, ready to make a difference. Thank you for your attention, and I hope to see each of you making your voice heard at the polls.",

Hannah's luggage kept breaking, and she went through four suitcases in 14 days! There we were, strolling down a busy street in Madrid and Hannah's clothes were falling out of her over-packed suitcase, painting the path behind us with her sundresses and socks. But she never let her rundown luggage ruin the trip. She just kept rolling with it. Literally. I can always depend on Hannah to roll with any situation, to show up for the people that she loves, and to have a good time.\n\nBut the truth is everyone in this room is better for knowing you, Hannah.

By sharing these emotions today, we hope to ease the pain and hold onto the precious memories more dearly.\n\nJason was 67 years old when he passed away last Tuesday at Oakwood Medical Center. He was born on May 21, 1938, in this very town of Middleton to Harold and Anne (Bradley) Wilson. Jason was a lifelong resident of Middleton, dedicating over 40 years to the farming community.\n\nClose to his family, friends, and his cherished cat, Whiskers, Jason played a significant role in our lives. Growing up with him as my older brother had its challenges. He loved teasing us, yet he was always the first to defend us against anyone else. He was a loyal friend and a dedicated worker, greatly valued by the Edwards family, his employers. We are all deeply grateful for their support and care, especially during his final years.\n\nAs a farmer, Jason not only worked hard but also knew how to enjoy life. He had a passion for fishing and hunting, whether it was deer, turkey, or geese. We shared numerous hunting adventures up North, although I must admit, some of those stories are best left untold. It was often joked that Jason might have spent more time napping under a tree than actually hunting. He had plans to retire up North, and though that didn't come to fruition, we will honor his memory by scattering his ashes at Marshall Point, his favorite hunting spot.\n\nJason's interests weren't limited to the outdoors. He was an avid collector of farm toys, a hobby we're acknowledging today with a display of some of his collection. He enjoyed playing cards, frequenting casinos, and was particularly fond of poker. He had a love for Western movies, especially those featuring John Wayne, and he had a taste for both types of music - Country and Western. Gene Autry's 'Red River Valley' was among his favorites.\n\nMany of you will fondly remember Jason's expansive garden. He took great joy in tending to it and generously shared his bountiful produce, especially those beautiful homegrown tomatoes, with friends in town. Jason was a man of kindness, without a hint of malice. He made a positive impact not through grand actions or titles but through his fundamental goodness, generosity, and the way he connected with others.\n\nJason's life was filled with wonderful moments, and he touched our lives in countless ways. He will be remembered as a loving brother, a loyal friend, a kind uncle and cousin, a skilled outdoorsman, poker player, collector, farmer, and a friendly face around town. His presence enriched our lives immeasurably.\n\nThough his passing leaves a void filled with sadness, confusion, and even anger at the untimely departure of a man only 67 years young, the essence of Jason's life remains with us. He continues to live in our memories, stories, and the impact he had on each of us. I encourage you to share your memories and stories, as well as the pain of this loss, both today and in the years to come. In doing so, we keep Jason's spirit alive and thriving.\n\nOn behalf of our family, I want to express our deepest thanks to all of you for being here with us today.",

        "reference_answer": "Esteemed guests and fellow explorers of the digital realm,\n\nToday, we stand at the frontier of an ever-evolving digital society, where social media platforms have become the modern agora, shaping and reflecting our societal norms and individual behaviors.\n\n**Social Media: A Mirror and Mold**\n\nSocial media is not just a tool for sharing and communication; it's a mirror reflecting our collective concerns, anxieties, and aspirations. Yet, it also acts as a mold, subtly shaping norms, behaviors, and identities. This dual role invites us to question how deeply our interactions online influence our perceptions of self and society.\n\n**The Construction of Digital Identities**\n\nIn this age of digital omnipresence, we curate our identities, carefully selecting the aspects we wish to publicize. The boundary between our public selves and private realities blurs, challenging traditional notions of authenticity and intimacy. Our social media profiles become arenas for identity experimentation, sometimes offering liberation but often under the watchful eyes of a digitized panopticon.\n\n**The Impact on Public Discourse and Privacy**\n\nPlatforms that were once bastions of free expression now navigate the thin line between curating content and censoring voices. Privacy norms, too, have shifted, with the digital footprint of individual activities becoming fodder for data analytics, raising significant ethical and sociological concerns about surveillance and consent.\n\n**Navigating the Digital Social Landscape**\n\nAs we ponder the future of our digital society, it is crucial to foster spaces that promote meaningful interactions, respect privacy, and encourage the healthy development of digital identities. Engaging with these platforms responsibly, we can harness their power to enhance societal well-being, rather than detracting from it.\n\nIn conclusion, let us embrace the digital age with critical minds and compassionate hearts, guiding the evolution of our digital society towards a more informed, inclusive, and introspective future.\n\nThank you for joining me in this exploration of our shared digital destiny.",

Today, we embark on a journey to unravel how our tongues and texts are being transformed under the weight of pixels and artificial intelligence.\n\n**Digital Platforms and Language Evolution**\n\nThe advent of digital communication has not just changed how we talk; it's rewriting the very DNA of language. From the shorthand of text messages to the memes that pervade social media, we're witnessing the birth of digital dialects. These new forms of expression, rich with emoji and internet slang, are not corrupting traditional language but expanding our expressive palette.\n\n**The Emergence of Digital Dialects**\n\nConsider how hashtags have evolved into a form of meta-commentary and community building, or how emoji sequences can convey complex emotions and narratives. These are the digital dialects of our time, a unique blend of brevity, symbolism, and global understandings, forging new pathways for human connection across the digital divide.\n\n**AI's Role in Future Communication**\n\nAs AI becomes more intertwined with our daily interactions, it's not just automating communication but shaping it. Predictive text, language translation algorithms, and even AI-authored content are becoming common. The question arises: how will AI further influence the evolution of language? Will AI help preserve endangered languages, or will it push us towards a homogenized mode of communication?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this digital age, our language is a living, breathing organism adapting to the rhythms of technology. As we look towards the future, let's embrace the diversity of our digital dialects and contemplate the role of AI in our linguistic evolution. Let this workshop be the start of a profound dialogue on the future of human expression in an increasingly connected world.\n\nThank you for joining this exploration, and may our discussions spark new insights and innovations in the field of digital linguistics.",
