For instance, the mining required for solar panel production also has environmental impacts.

Lucas, however, voices concerns about echo chambers and misinformation potentially skewing public opinion in harmful ways.\nElla: Social media has broken down barriers to political engagement, enabling grassroots movements to gain momentum.\nLucas: While that's true, the prevalence of echo chambers on these platforms can lead to polarized communities. And what about the spread of misinformation?\nElla: Active participation and critical thinking from users can counter echo chambers. Moreover, platforms are increasingly implementing fact-checking measures to combat misinformation.\nLucas: That sounds ideal, but in practice, it's hard to guarantee the effectiveness of these measures.
