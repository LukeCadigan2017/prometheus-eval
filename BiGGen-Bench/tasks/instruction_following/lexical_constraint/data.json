        "reference_answer": "Here is an explanation on Pavlov's dog experiments as an example of the theory of Classical Conditioning using the specified terms:\n[Unconditioned response through Unconditioned stimulus]\nPavlov provided an unconditioned stimulus, food, to dogs to elicit a natural response without any prior learning. The food naturally caused salivation in the dogs. When presented with this unconditioned stimulus, the dogs exhibited an unconditioned response of salivating. This response occurred spontaneously without the need for any learning.\n[Converting Neutral stimulus to Conditioned stimulus]\nNext, a neutral stimulus that initially did not elicit any response was introduced and paired with the unconditioned stimulus to induce a response. This process is known as classical conditioning. In Pavlov's experiment, the neutral stimulus was something like a bell or metronome. This neutral stimulus was associated with the unconditioned stimulus, which is food. Through repeated pairings, the neutral stimulus became a conditioned stimulus.\n[Conditioned response through Conditioned stimulus]\nAs a result of this conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (such as the sound of the bell or metronome) came to elicit a conditioned response. Even without the presence of food, the dogs would salivate in response to the conditioned stimulus, demonstrating that the neutral stimulus had become a conditioned stimulus capable of triggering a conditioned response.\nIn summary, Classical Conditioning involves the association of a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response. The process demonstrates how a previously neutral stimulus can acquire the ability to evoke a response through repeated pairings with a stimulus that naturally triggers a response. Pavlov's experiments provided a foundational understanding of classical conditioning in psychology.",
