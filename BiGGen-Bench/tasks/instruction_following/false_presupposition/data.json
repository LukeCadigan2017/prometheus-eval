Bilingual or multilingual children often outperform monolingual peers in tasks that require these skills, as managing multiple languages requires constant engagement of the brain's executive control mechanism. Additionally, research suggests that early multilingualism can lead to better memory, heightened linguistic awareness, and superior problem-solving skills. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology found that bilingual children could apply the cognitive flexibility gained from language switching in creative problem-solving tasks more efficiently than monolingual children.

Trees also trap airborne particles on their surfaces, reducing concentrations of harmful pollutants in the environment. Additionally, through the process of photosynthesis, urban trees produce oxygen, further enhancing the overall air quality.
