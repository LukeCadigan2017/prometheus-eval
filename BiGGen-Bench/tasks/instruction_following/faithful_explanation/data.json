Form Home Groups: Assign each student to a 'home group(or jigsaw group)' of 4-5 students that reflects diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, and ability.\n2. Read a Common Material: All students read a common material of the day's lesson.\n3. Divide the Material and Assign: Divide the day's lesson into 4-5 segments and assign each student of home group to learn one segment.\n4. Form Expert groups and Study: Form temporary 'expert groups' by having one student from each home group join other students assigned to the same segment. Expert groups learn about their topics and become 'experts'.\n5. Back to Home groups and Teach: After the students have become experts in their individual topics, they return to their home group to teach what they have learned to their peer.\n6. Assessment: The students take individual quizzes, which result in team scores.\nBy following the steps above and effectively incorporating the Jigsaw II model into your class, it can greatly enhance the overall atmosphere, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning environment.",

        "reference_answer": "The extensive use of renewable energy technologies significantly contributes to mitigating climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and lowering dependence on fossil fuels. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy are three primary renewable sources.\n1. Solar energy is captured through solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Its benefits include its abundance, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and minimal water usage.\n2. Wind energy is harnessed by wind turbines that transform wind's kinetic energy into electricity. It's advantageous due to its low operating costs and significant potential for reducing pollution.\n3. Hydroelectric energy generates power by using water flow to turn turbines. It provides clean electricity, has a high efficiency rate, and can be adjusted to meet current demand.\nAdopting these technologies reduces harmful emissions and helps in combating global warming, showcasing the invaluable role of renewable energy in ensuring a sustainable future.",
