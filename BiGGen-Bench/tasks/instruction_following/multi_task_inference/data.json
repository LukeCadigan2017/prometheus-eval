Use your own words as much as possible.\n\nText:\nMarie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist who became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to ever win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Her first Nobel Prize, in Physics, was awarded in 1903 alongside her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. In 1911, she won her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. Her work not only advanced the understanding of atomic science but also laid the groundwork for future research in nuclear physics and cancer treatment.",

Her most notable achievements include being the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the only individual to be awarded Nobel Prizes in two distinct scientific disciplines. In 1903, she was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, in recognition of their collective research on radioactivity. This groundbreaking work was pivotal in advancing the understanding of atomic structures and phenomena.\n\nCurie's relentless pursuit of knowledge led to her second Nobel Prize in 1911, this time in the field of Chemistry. This award was in acknowledgment of her discovery of two previously unknown elements, radium and polonium. These discoveries were not only monumental in expanding the periodic table but also played a crucial role in the development of nuclear physics and medical treatments, particularly in the fight against cancer.\n\nThe significance of Curie's work cannot be overstated. Her pioneering research on radioactivity opened new avenues in science, leading to innovations in nuclear energy, radiography, and cancer therapy. Her achievements set the stage for future scientific explorations and have had a lasting impact on both science and medicine, making her one of the most influential figures in the history of science.",

In terms of social relationships, while smartphones enable constant connectivity and access to social networks, they can also lead to a sense of isolation and decreased face-to-face interactions, potentially exacerbating feelings of loneliness among youths. Research indicates that excessive use may impair the development of real-world social skills.\n\nConcerning attention span, there's evidence to suggest that the instant gratification provided by smartphones can reduce the ability to focus on prolonged tasks or activities, potentially affecting educational outcomes. Sleep patterns are also affected, with studies showing that screen time, especially before bed, can disrupt sleep quality and duration, impacting overall well-being.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, the incessant need to check updates or compare oneself to others on social media platforms can lead to increased levels of anxiety and depression. However, smartphones can also serve as valuable tools for mental health support, offering apps for mindfulness, emotional regulation, and connection with supportive communities.\n\nOverall, the impact of smartphones on youth mental health is multifaceted, requiring a balanced approach to maximize benefits while minimizing potential harms.

        "reference_answer": "Streaming services have revolutionized the music industry by altering the landscape of artist exposure, consumer behavior, revenue models, and even the production and distribution of music itself. Firstly, these platforms have democratized artist exposure, allowing lesser-known artists to be discovered by a global audience without the need for traditional marketing or distribution channels, thanks to algorithm-driven recommendations.\n\nConsumer listening habits have shifted towards a preference for playlists and single tracks, rather than full albums, with accessibility and personalization at the forefront. This change challenges artists to release music that can stand alone outside the context of an album.\n\nRevenue models have also evolved, with streaming royalties becoming a critical income source for artists and labels, though this has prompted discussions about the fairness and adequacy of payouts. Additionally, the ease of distribution has encouraged more frequent releases and singles as artists strive to stay relevant in constantly updating feeds.\n\nMoreover, the influence on music production is evident in shorter song lengths and the optimization of tracks for streaming algorithms, potentially prioritizing catchy hooks and chorus to ensure listener retention. This denotes a cultural shift in how music is created, distributed, and consumed, emphasizing streaming's profound impact on the industry.",
