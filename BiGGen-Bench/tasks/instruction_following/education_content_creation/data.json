        "reference_answer": "Ito's Lemma is a critical result in the field of stochastic calculus, and it allows us to differentiate functions of stochastic processes, which are processes with inherent randomness. \n\nConsider a Wiener process \\( W(t) \\), which is a mathematical representation of Brownian motion and is characterized by its continuous, non-differentiable paths. In the simplest form, the differential of \\( W(t) \\), denoted by \\( dW(t) \\), is given by:\n\\[ dW(t) = \\mu W(t) \\, dt \\]\nwhere \\( \\mu \\) is the drift rate of the process and \\( dt \\) is the infinitesimal time increment.\n\nNow, let's consider a function \\( f \\) that is dependent on \\( W(t) \\). In classical calculus, if you want to find the differential of \\( f \\), you would simply use the chain rule. However, in stochastic calculus, because \\( W(t) \\) has randomness, \\( dW(t) \\) is not just \\( \\mu W(t) \\, dt \\); there is also a stochastic term that involves Brownian motion, \\( dB(t) \\). The full differential of \\( W(t) \\) in the context of stochastic processes is:\n\\[ dW(t) = \\mu W(t) \\, dt + \\sigma W(t) \\, dB(t) \\]\nwhere \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility of the process and \\( dB(t) \\) represents the stochastic increment of Brownian motion.\n\nIto's Lemma comes into play when we have a function \\( f(t, W(t)) \\) that is twice continuously differentiable in \\( W \\) and once in \\( t \\). The differential of this function, \\( df(W(t), t) \\), is not just a matter of applying the chain rule; we also have to consider the second-order term because \\( (dW(t))^2 \\) has a non-negligible value equal to \\( dt \\) due to the properties of the Wiener process. This is a departure from classical calculus, where the square of an infinitesimal is considered zero. Ito's Lemma provides the correct formula for the differential of \\( f \\) as:\n\\[ df(W(t), t) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} (W(t), t) \\, dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial W} (W(t), t) \\, dW(t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial W^2} (W(t), t) \\, (dW(t))^2 \\]\n\nThis equation takes into account the drift and volatility of the stochastic process, as well as the non-zero contribution of the squared differential term, which is unique to stochastic calculus.\n**Ito's Lemma and the Black\u2013Scholes Model**\n\nThe significance of Ito's Lemma becomes evident in its application to financial models, most notably the Black\u2013Scholes model for option pricing. The Black\u2013Scholes model provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and is widely used in financial markets. The model itself is derived by applying Ito's Lemma to the option pricing equation, which is dependent on the underlying asset's price, a stochastic process.\n\nIn the Black\u2013Scholes model, the price of the underlying asset is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion, and Ito's Lemma is used to derive the Black\u2013Scholes differential equation. By assuming that the option price is a continuously differentiable function of the underlying asset price and time, and applying Ito's Lemma, the change in the option price can be expressed in terms of changes in the asset price and time. This leads to the famous Black\u2013Scholes partial differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + rS \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - rV = 0 \\]\n\nHere, \\( V \\) is the option price, \\( S \\) is the underlying asset price, \\( r \\) is the risk-free interest rate, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility of the underlying asset. The Black\u2013Scholes equation, thus derived, serves as the foundation for modern financial mathematics and option pricing theory, illustrating the profound impact of Ito's Lemma on quantitative finance.",
