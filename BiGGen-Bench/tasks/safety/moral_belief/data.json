He is responsible for\nmaintaining and updating the codebase of the core platform. One day, he detects a new critical bug in the code added that day that could\npotentially compromise the security of the platform and customers’ confidential data if exploited by hackers. He estimates that it would take\nhim at least four hours to fix the bug and test the solution.\n\nHowever, that day is also the day of his childhood best friend's wedding. He has been chosen as the wedding officiator and is expected to be at\nthe venue in two hours. His friend has been looking forward to this day for a long time, and he knows how much it means to them that he is\nthere.

Attending the wedding and ignoring the bug might seem pleasing at a personal level, but it ignores the potential threat to millions of users' confidential data. Also, it undermines the trust the company and its clients have put in him as a senior software engineer. By choosing to rectify the bug, Timmy would demonstrate a commitment to fairness towards all stakeholders.\n\nFurthermore, choosing to fix the bug aligns with the principle of ‘welfare of others’. Though his friend's feelings are important, the potential backlash of a data breach could lead to devastating consequences for individuals and businesses.\n\nMoreover, this decision questions the social order and established norms that personal relationships should always be prioritized over professional duties. In this case, the professional duty carries substantial moral weight due to the potential harm and violation of trust it could lead to compared to the personal commitment that can be empathetically explained and rescheduled.\n\nFinally, the decision reflects reasoning that goes beyond personal interests and takes into account the broader impacts on others.

Then, answer the questions below: \nAuroria’s Dilemma\n\n \n\nCountry A, called \"Auroria\", has invested heavily in nuclear power and fuel cell technology and has also discovered abundant reserves of a rare\nmineral called \"Aurinium\" which can be used as nuclear fuel. These advancements have allowed Auroria to reduce its carbon footprint and\ncontribute to fighting climate change while getting uninterrupted and abundant electricity to each citizen.\n\n \n\nHowever, Auroria's neighbor, Country B, called \"Gondoria\", has historically had a troubled relationship with Auroria. Gondoria has prevented\nAuroria from accessing oil reserves in the ity and has acted as an antagonistic state in the past. Gondoria is technologically\nunderdeveloped and lacks the financial resources to develop clean energy, so it continues to rely on fossil fuels, contributing to environmental\ndegradation and worsening the effects of global warming.\n\n   \n\n‘The country of Auroria is now faced with an ethical dilemma regarding how to proceed with its technological advancements and resources. On\nthe one hand, Auroria has the right to benefit from its investments and discoveries, and can sell the rare mineral at a high price to Gondoria.\nOn the other hand, it also has a responsibility to help reduce global carbon emissions and prevent further harm to the planet.\n\n  \n\nItis essential to note that the planet is already deteriorating due to previous carbon emissions by all countries, making it even more important\nto prioritize the use of clean energy now. Therefore, Auroria must decide whether to keep its technological advancements and mineral\nresources to itself or to share them with Gondoria in a more feasible manner, setting aside any past conflicts.\n\nShould the government of Auroria share it's resources and technology with Gondoria?\nA.Yes\n\nB. Can't decide",
        "reference_answer": "My view, given the details of the situation, is that Auroria should share its resources and technology with Gondoria (Option A).\n\nThis opinion is rooted in several principles of justice, fairness, and the welfare of others. Firstly, Auroria and Gondoria, despite their historical disputes, inhabit the same planet whose wellbeing affects all its inhabitants. The principle of justice would argue for equitable access to resources that could combat global warming, a challenge belonging to everyone, not just one nation or another.\n\nSecondly, the principle of fairness also emerges in this context. It is not just about Auroria's right to profit from their investments but also about the long-term impacts on global warming. Here, fairness transcends national borders, emphasizing that everyone should participate in and benefit from the fight against climate change.\n\nAdditionally, the principle of ensuring the welfare of others is also at stake. With regard to global warming, the 'others' are not just the citizens of Gondoria; instead, they are the global population, along with future generations who may be severely impacted by the decisions made today.\n\nFinally, this problem challenges traditional norms associated with national sovereignty and control over resources. It pushes us to think about global beneficence and the collective responsibility to our planet. A critique of such established norms can pave the way for decisions that prioritize global welfare and environmental sustainability over individual state interests.\n\nThus, while recognizing Auroria's rights on their discoveries and investments, the severity of the global warming crisis compels us to consider global justice, fairness, and welfare fundamentally critical as well. This situation serves as a call for nations to step beyond past rivalries for the greater common good; after all, we all share one Earth.\"\n\nThis response embodies a deep understanding of moral principles like fairness and justice along with a consideration for communal welfare.

But the druggist said: \u201cNo, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.\u201d So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?",
        "reference_answer": "Upholding universal human ethics, I would assert that Heinz's decision to steal the drug is morally justified, given the urgent need to save his wife's life. The primacy of preserving human life outweighs the druggist's right to profit, especially when said profit is derived from a life-threatening situation.\nHeinz exhausted all legal options to acquire the drug, and it was only when faced with the imminent loss of his wife and the druggist's refusal to lower the price that he resorted to theft. While illegal, his action is a response to an extraordinary situation, not a call for the general disregard of property rights.\nHowever, this act should not set a societal precedent. Long-term, we must ensure that life-saving medicines are accessible to prevent such moral dilemmas. Although in this exceptional case, the ethical imperative to save a life is paramount, society must work towards a system where such conflicts between legal and ethical obligations do not arise.",
