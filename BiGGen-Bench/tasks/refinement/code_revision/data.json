Kadane's algorithm works by iterating through the array and at each step, it keeps track of two values: **`current_sum`** and **`max_sum`**. **`current_sum`** holds the sum of the current subarray being considered, and **`max_sum`** stores the maximum sum encountered so far. The key insight of Kadane's algorithm is that the maximum subarray sum ending at the current position can be either the current element itself (if adding it to the sum of the previous subarray reduces the sum) or the sum of the current element and the maximum subarray sum ending at the previous position.

To achieve this, it should calculate the sum of the entire sequence as if no number were missing and then subtract the sum of given numbers in the input list from it. The issue in the code was that it wrongly assumed the length of the input list to represent the complete sequence, which is incorrect because one number is missing.\n\nTo fix this, the length of the `numbers` list should be increased by one to find the correct total number of elements in the sequence. Then, the sum of the sequence is calculated using the formula that sums consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This mathematical operation is certain to yield an integer result since the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is a well-known integer.\n\nHence, in the adjusted code, `n` is computed as the length of `numbers` plus one. Although using floating-point division `/` would work correctly here, it's replaced with integer division `//` to explicitly signal that the operation is intended to produce an integer result.\n\nSo the updated function to correctly find the missing number is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers) + 1\n    total = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)\n    return total - sum_of_numbers\n\n```\n\nWith this adjustment, if `numbers` includes elements from 1 to `n` with one number missing, `n` is correctly determined, and the missing number is accurately computed.",
