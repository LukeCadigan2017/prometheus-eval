        "input": "The English language is nowadays as good as impossible to avoid if you lead a regular life. You hear it on TV, in musical lyrics, you study it in school and for many people using the English language is part of their everyday work. This constant interaction with the language results in a fairly good sense of how the language should be used. I think most people can understand at least some English and quite a few probably master it very well. However, looking at my own abilities in this language it is quite clear that some areas are more problematic than others. I find myself being more confident reguardingthe more passive skills of the language, that is reading and listening, whereas writing and speaking are more difficult areas.\nThroughout the years I've studied English, first in elementary school and then in upper school, theteachers have always emphasized writing. Especially in upper school we wrote many essays and different kinds of reviews. But even though I've had quite a bit of practise when it comes to writing English there are still problems. Spelling, of course, can sometimes be difficult, but a worse problem from my point of view is that of grammatical errors. These problems are, in my experience, often complicated and not as easy to come to terms with as for example the spelling of a word which you can easily look up in a dictionary.\nWhen it comes to reading we didn't get very much practise in that in school. Of course we had textbooks, but the articles in them were often very short, each covering different topics which gave the impression that they were taken out of context. In other words, the textbooks were boring. Besides these texts we also read a number of literary books on which we made reviews. I think reading actual literature is a tremendously rewarding way of learning a language more fluently. I also had great advantages from this when I studied religious science since a lot of the literature in the courses was in English.\nThe most severe problem I have reguading reading English texts occurs when the texts are written in professional language. To read an English text which probably would cause trouble even if it was written in Swedish, that is a true challenge and at the same time very time-consuming. This also brings to mind another problem with my reading, namely my patience, or rather lack thereof. Naturally, at least to begin with, it is a slower process reading an English text than a Swedish one, but of some reason I have a hard time accepting that...\nThe two skills of talking and listening are obviously closely related. Still I think listening is the easiest of the four skills while talking is the most difficult one. This undoubtedly has to do with the fact that you automatically get much more practise in listening, especially from TV and music, than in talking. Of course you don't understand every word, but usually you don't have any problem grasping the context. Despite this, the problem with professional language exists in listening as well as in reading.\nLike I stated above, my biggest problem reguarding the English language has to do with speaking. I haven't had any real experience in speaking English since I haven't been abroad for any longer period. Since the teaching of English in school is based primarily or even exclusively on theory I haven't got any practise there either. If anything, school makes you want to talk even less; you get so hung up on getting everything grammaticaly correct that you don't dare open your mouth fearing to be laughed at. I know this sounds horrible and it probably doesn't apply to everyone, but on the other hand, I believe the fears will disappear quite quickly if you actually start talking.\nHaving completed this assignment I have to say it's really hard to judge oneself in the four skills of language. I have never had any problems attaining good grades in English in school, but on the other hand I'm a firm believer in the thought that grades rarely say anything about someones' actual knowledge. All I know is that there are many different areas in a language, and I would like to increase my knowledge in all of them.\n\nRevise the essay above to make it sound like it was written by a native English speaker.",
        "reference_answer": "In today's world, avoiding the English language is nearly impossible in daily life. It's everywhere: on TV, in the lyrics of songs, taught in schools, and for many, it's an integral part of work. This constant exposure generally leads to a decent understanding of how the language should be used. Most people likely grasp some level of English, with many achieving proficiency. Reflecting on my own skills, it's clear that certain aspects pose more challenges than others. I feel more comfortable with passive skills like reading and listening, whereas writing and speaking prove more difficult.\n\nThroughout my education, from elementary to high school, there was a strong emphasis on writing. In high school, we frequently wrote essays and various reviews. Despite considerable practice in writing, challenges persist. Spelling can be tricky, but grammatical errors present a bigger issue for me. These errors are often complex and not as easily resolved as checking a word's spelling in a dictionary.\n\nOur reading practice in school was limited. The textbooks contained short articles on diverse topics, which seemed disjointed and dull. However, reading literary works for reviews was incredibly enriching and greatly aided my language fluency. This also benefitted me during my religious studies, which involved a significant amount of English literature.\n\nI encounter difficulties with professional or technical English texts, which are challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, I struggle with patience when reading in English, as it naturally takes longer than reading in my native Swedish, a fact I find hard to accept.\n\nListening and speaking, while related, vary in difficulty for me; listening is easier, likely because of more passive exposure through media like TV and music. Understanding the context usually isn't an issue, but professional jargon can be as challenging in listening as it is in reading.\n\nSpeaking is my greatest challenge. Without substantial experience speaking English abroad or practical application in school, where the focus was more theoretical, my confidence in speaking is low. School tended to emphasize grammatical correctness, which made me hesitant to speak for fear of making mistakes. However, I believe that actively speaking can quickly overcome these fears.\n\nAssessing my proficiency in English's four key skills is challenging. While I've achieved good grades, I believe they don't fully reflect one's true knowledge. My goal is to improve in all areas of the language.",

        "input": "Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water once existed in great quantity on the surface of Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: runoff channels and outflow channels. Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands. These flow features are extensive systems\u2014sometimes hundreds of kilometers in total length\u2014of interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to merge into larger, wider channels. They bear a strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and geologists think that they are dried-up beds of long-gone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from the mountains down into the valleys. Runoff channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and liquid water widespread.\n\nOutflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks. Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped \"islands\" (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous\u2014perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river. Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago, about the same time as the northern volcanic plains formed.\n\nSome scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta\u2014a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands. Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expanses of water on the early Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the Martian north polar region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin's rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea.\n\nThese ideas remain controversial. Proponents point to features such as the terraced \"beaches\" shown in one image, which could conceivably have been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and the shoreline receded. But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water. Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers\u2014layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen\u2014that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean. Their absence supports the picture of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the extended mild period required to form lakes and oceans. However, more recent data imply that at least some parts of the planet did in fact experience long periods in the past during which liquid water existed on the surface.\n\nAside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny. Yet even setting aside the unproven hints of ancient oceans, the extent of the outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all the water go? The answer may be that virtually all the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost layer under the surface, with more contained in the planet's polar caps.\n\nRewrite each passage with simpler language.",
        "reference_answer": "Photos from space show that Mars once had a lot of water on its surface. There are two main types of water paths seen: runoff channels and outflow channels. Runoff channels are in the southern highlands and look like river systems on Earth. They suggest that long ago, Mars had rivers made by rainwater flowing from mountains to valleys. This happened about 4 billion years ago when Mars was warmer and had a thicker atmosphere.\n\nOutflow channels are found near the equator and were likely caused by massive floods. These floods came from the southern highlands and moved to the northern plains, forming teardrop-shaped \"islands\" along the way. The amount of water flowing through these channels was huge, much more than the Amazon river. These floods happened around 3 billion years ago, around the same time as volcanic activity in the north.\n\nSome scientists think Mars had rivers, lakes, and maybe even oceans early in its history. A 2003 image from the Mars Global Surveyor shows what might be a river delta in a crater. Other images suggest there might have been a big ocean in the northern lowlands and a sea in the Hellas Basin. But, not everyone agrees. Some say the features could be from geological activity, not water. Also, there's not enough carbonate rock, which should be there if there were oceans.\n\nAlthough recent finds of small gullies on Mars don't prove there's water now, the large outflow channels suggest Mars had lots of water in the past. This water might now be frozen underground or in the polar ice caps.",
