If Alex takes 5 shots in a game, what is the probability that he scores exactly 2 goals? Explain your reasoning. Your final answer should be in the form of a percentage, with two decimal places, like this: XX.XX%.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo find the probability that Alex scores exactly 2 goals out of 5 shots, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * ((1 - p)^(n - k))\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, 2 goals).\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 shots).\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 2 goals).\n- p is the probability of success on an individual trial (in this case, 0.4 or 40%).\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = (5 choose 2) * (0.4^2) * ((1 - 0.4)^(5 - 2))\n\nFirst, let's calculate (5 choose 2):\n\n(5 choose 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.4^2) * (0.6^3)\n\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (0.16) * (0.216)\n\nP(X = 2) = 3.456%\n\nSo, the probability that Alex scores exactly 2 goals out of 5 shots is approximately 3.46%.",

First, calculate \\( (5 choose 2) \\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 successes in 5 trials. It's calculated as 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!), which is (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10.\n2. Next, calculate \\( 0.4^2 \\), which is the probability of scoring a goal twice: 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16.\n3. Then, calculate \\( (1 - 0.4)^{5 - 2} \\), which is the probability of not scoring a goal in the remaining shots: 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.216.\n4. Now, multiply these values together: 10 * 0.16 * 0.216 = 0.3456.\n5. Finally, convert this to a percentage: 0.3456 * 100 = 34.56%.\n\nSo, the probability that Alex scores exactly 2 goals out of 5 shots is approximately 34.56%.",

Explain your reasoning. Your final answer should be in the form of a numerical number, with the unit, like this: XX sq. meters.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo find the available square meters for planting tulip bulbs, we need to subtract the area occupied by the 1-meter-wide border from the total area of the garden.\nThe original dimensions of the rectangular garden are 10 meters by 15 meters, so its total area is:\n10 meters \u00d7 15 meters = 150 square meters\nNow, we need to calculate the area occupied by the 1-meter-wide border. Since the border is all around the garden, we will consider only one side (e.g., the length) to simplify the calculation.\nThe side of the inner rectangle (where we can plant tulips) will be 10 meters - 2 meters (border on both sides) = 8 meters. This is because the border is 1 meter wide on each side, so it reduces the garden's length by 2 meters.\nThe area of the border is:\n1 meter (border width) \u00d7 8 meters (inner length) = 8 square meters\nThe area of the 1-meter-wide border all around the garden (all four sides) would be:\n8 square meters \u00d7 4 sides = 32 square meters\nNow, we subtract the area occupied by the border from the total area of the garden:\n150 square meters (total area) - 32 square meters (border area) = 118 square meters\nSo, there are 118 sq. meters available for planting tulip bulbs in the garden, leaving a 1-meter-wide border around the edges free of tulips.",

This subtraction accounts for the border on both sides of each dimension.\n\n- The adjusted length is 10 meters - 2 meters = 8 meters (subtracting the border from both ends).\n- The adjusted width is 15 meters - 2 meters = 13 meters (subtracting the border from both sides).\n\nTherefore, the area available for planting is calculated as follows:\nAvailable area = Adjusted length x Adjusted width = 8 meters x 13 meters = 104 square meters\n\nSo, there are 104 sq. meters available for planting tulip bulbs in the garden, leaving a 1-meter-wide border around the edges free of tulips.",

Each sword takes 3 hours to forge and an additional hour for finishing touches. If the blacksmith works 10 hours a day, how many days will it take to complete the order? Explain your reasoning and provide the final answer in the form of a whole number.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo calculate the total time needed to make 100 swords, we must consider the time it takes to forge each sword and the time for finishing touches.\nEach sword takes 3 hours to forge and an additional 1 hour for finishing touches, making a total of 4 hours per sword.\nSo for 100 swords:\n\n100 swords * 4 hours/sword = 400 hours\n\nThe blacksmith works 10 hours a day, so to find out how many days it will take, we divide the total hours of work by the number of hours the blacksmith works per day:\n\n400 hours \u00f7 10 hours/day = 40 days\n\nTherefore, it will take the blacksmith 40 days to complete the order of 100 swords, assuming they work 10 hours a day and there are no days off.",
        "reference_answer": "In a medieval setting, forging a sword is a meticulous and continuous process that needs to be completed in one go for each sword. This is crucial because stopping midway through and resuming the next day could compromise the quality and integrity of the sword. The metal, once heated for forging, requires consistent shaping and handling until the sword is formed. Discontinuing the process would mean reheating the metal and potentially affecting its strength and uniformity.\n\nEach sword takes 3 hours to forge, plus an additional hour for the finishing touches, totaling 4 hours to complete one sword. Given that the blacksmith works a 10-hour day, they can complete 2 swords each day. This is because while 10 divided by 4 equals 2.5, indicating 2 and a half swords per day, the blacksmith cannot forge half a sword and complete it the following day. Therefore, only 2 whole swords can be realistically completed in a single day.\n\nConsidering this, to complete an order of 100 swords, the blacksmith would need 50 days. This is calculated by dividing the total number of swords (100) by the number of swords that can be completed each day (2), resulting in 50 days.

Explain your reasoning and provide the final answer in the form of a whole number.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo cross the English Channel by balloon, you must consider the average speed of the winds which would likely carry the balloon across. With an average wind speed of 15 miles per hour and the width of the channel being 21 miles, you would divide the distance by the speed to calculate the time taken:\n\n21 miles \u00f7 15 mph = 1.4 hours\n\nTherefore, it took approximately 1.4 hours, or roughly 1 hour and 24 minutes to cross the English Channel in a hot air balloon.",
        "reference_answer": "When considering the flight of a hot air balloon across the English Channel in 1783, one must take into account the limitations of early balloon aviation. The Montgolfier brothers' balloons were at the mercy of the wind, with virtually no directional control. Although one could divide the 21-mile width of the channel by the 15 mph average wind speed to estimate 1.4 hours for the crossing, this ignores factors such as variable winds and piloting experience.\n\nPractically speaking, due to the possible variations in wind speed and direction, a realistic crossing time would likely exceed the simple calculation. Therefore, a more careful estimation would suggest a time range. Considering optimal conditions, the crossing might take as little as 1.4 hours, but factoring in variables, a range of 2 to 4 hours is more plausible.\n\nTo summarize, while under perfect conditions the crossing could take around 1.4 hours, it is more reasonable to suggest that it would have taken approximately \\boxed{3 hours} for the first hot air balloon to cross the English Channel, accounting for the lack of control and inconsistency of early balloon flight.",

The pool has dimensions of 25 meters in length, 10 meters in width, and an average depth of 2 meters. If water is pumped into the pool at a rate of 500 liters per minute, how long will it take to completely fill the pool? Provide your reasoning and the final answer in the form of a numerical number, rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo find out how long it will take to fill the pool, first calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular pool is found by multiplying its length by its width and by its depth:\n\n25 meters * 10 meters * 2 meters = 500 cubic meters\n\nSince 1 cubic meter is equivalent to 1,000 liters, the pool holds:\n\n500 cubic meters * 1,000 = 500,000 liters\n\nWith the pump filling at a rate of 500 liters per minute, the time to fill the pool is:\n\n500,000 liters / 500 liters/minute = 1,000 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take 1,000 minutes to completely fill the pool.",
        "reference_answer": "To accurately calculate how long it will take to refill the swimming pool, we first need to determine the pool's total volume. The pool's dimensions are given as 25 meters in length, 10 meters in width, and an average depth of 2 meters. Multiplying these dimensions gives us the volume:\n\nVolume = length * width * depth = 25m * 10m * 2m = 500 cubic meters.\n\nNext, we convert the pool volume from cubic meters to liters, knowing that 1 cubic meter equals 1,000 liters, resulting in 500 cubic meters being equivalent to 500,000 liters.\n\nGiven the pumping rate is 500 liters per minute, the time needed to fill the pool is calculated by dividing the total volume needed by the rate:\n\n500,000 liters / 500 liters/minute = 1,000 minutes.\n\nTherefore, under these conditions, it will take approximately 1,000 minutes, or about 16 hours and 40 minutes (rounding to the nearest whole number), to completely fill the pool.",

If a seed is planted in the year 2000, in which years will the plant bloom for the first three times? Provide your reasoning and the final answer in a list form.\n\n### Previous Answer\n\nTo determine the years in which the plant will bloom for the first three times, we calculate the bloom cycle starting from the year the seed was planted. Since the rare plant species blooms every 7 years, starting from the year 2000:\n\n1st bloom: 2000 + 7 = 2007\n2nd bloom: 2007 + 7 = 2014\n3rd bloom: 2014 + 7 = 2021\n\nTherefore, the plant will bloom in the years 2007, 2014, and 2021.",
        "reference_answer": "To accurately project the bloom years for the rare plant species from a seed planted in 2000, we account for the plant's unique characteristic of blooming every 7 years. Therefore, calculating the first three bloom years from 2000 involves adding 7 years for each bloom cycle:\n\n- 1st bloom: 2000 + 7 = 2007\n- 2nd bloom: 2007 + 7 = 2014\n- 3rd bloom: 2014 + 7 = 2021\n\nSo, considering its 7-year bloom cycle starting from the year 2000, the plant will bloom in 2007, 2014, and 2021. This shows a precise understanding of the blooming pattern and correct arithmetic application.",
