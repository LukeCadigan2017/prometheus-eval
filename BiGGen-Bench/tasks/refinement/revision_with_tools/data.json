        "input": "Question: What screenwriter with credits for \"Evolution\" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni? Proposed Answer: The film starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni is The Family Man. The screenwriter for The Family Man is David Diamond. So the answer is: David Diamond.\nLet\u2019s search the question in google:\nSearch Query: What screenwriter with credits for \"Evolution\" co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni? Evidence: David Weissmanis an American screenwriter and director, most known for his comedies. He frequently collaborates withDavid Diamond.[1]Diamond and Weissman met in high school, at Akiba Hebrew Academy (nowJack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy).[2]They graduated in 1983. His film credits includeDream a Little Dream 2 (his only produced project not co-written with Diamond),The Family Man,[3][4]Old Dogs,When in Rome,[5]Evolution[6]and the television filmMinutemen. The duo sold their first spec script,The Whiz Kid, to 20th Century Fox in 1994. Their first produced project came in 2000,The Family Manstarring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni. Cage's production company,Saturn Films, helped produce the film.The Family Manopened at #3 at the North American box office making $15.1 million in its opening weekend, behindWhat Women WantandCast Away, which opened at the top spot.[7] Diamond and Weissman next wrote the sci-fi comedyEvolution, helmed byIvan Reitman.Evolutionwas based on a story by Don Jakoby, who turned it into a screenplay along with Diamond and Weissman. The film was originally written as a serious horror science fiction film, until director Reitman re-wrote much of the script. A short-livedanimated series,Alienators: Evolution Continues, loosely based on the film, was broadcast months after the film was released.[8]In 2005, they partnered withWedding Crashersproducer Andrew Panay onOld DogsandWhen In Rome. In 2019, the duo published ascreenwritingmanual,Bulletproof: Writing Scripts That Don't Get Shot Down.[9]The book draws from their extensive film experience.\n\nRead through the search query and evidence passage, and think step by step of how to revised the initally proposed answer.",
        "reference_answer": "Upon examining the provided passage for the identity of a screenwriter credited with \"Evolution\" and who also co-wrote a film starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni, it becomes evident that David Weissman fits the criteria. The passage details the professional partnership between David Weissman and David Diamond, highlighting their collaborative work on various projects, including \"The Family Man\" and \"Evolution.\" Notably, \"The Family Man\", which stars Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni, is mentioned as their first produced project, and \"Evolution\" is listed among their subsequent works. Given that the passage explicitly associates both Weissman and Diamond with these films, and considering the query specifies a screenwriter from \"Evolution\" involved in a project with Cage and Leoni, David Weissman is also a valid answer. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that David Weissman is the co-writer in question.",

However, it could be improved by including the potential increase in electricity rates over the 20-year period, which would further enhance the savings from the solar panels as electricity becomes more expensive. Additionally, considering any available government incentives or rebates for solar panel installation could provide a more accurate upfront cost figure, potentially increasing the overall savings. Furthermore, the potential increase in home value due to the installation of solar panels, although difficult to quantify, could be mentioned as an additional long-term benefit.
