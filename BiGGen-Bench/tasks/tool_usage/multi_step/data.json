Washington, D.C., USA:\n\n<search> Today's average temperature in Washington, D.C. </search>\n\nb. Seoul, South Korea:\n\n<search> Today's average temperature in Seoul </search>\n\nc. Beijing, China:\n\n<search> Today's average temperature in Beijing </search>\n\n- These searches will provide me with today's average temperature data for each capital city.\n3.

The budget should include costs for the venue, food, entertainment, decorations, and a contingency fund.",
        "reference_answer": "To create a budget for the birthday party, we need to gather information on the average costs of various items and services required for the party. The main categories to consider are:\n\n1. Venue: The cost of renting a location for the party.\n2. Food: Catering costs or the cost of buying and preparing food.\n3. Entertainment: Fees for any performers or activities.\n4. Decorations: Costs for items to decorate the venue.\n5. Contingency Fund: An extra amount for unforeseen expenses.\n\nWe'll use the Search Engine tool to find average costs for each of these categories. The search queries should be specific to get the most relevant results. Let's formulate the queries:\n\n1. **Search for Venue Costs**:\n- Query: 'average cost of renting a party venue in [your city/area]' (replace [your city/area] with the actual location of the party).\n2. **Search for Food Costs**:\n- Query: 'average catering cost for a birthday party' or 'average cost of food per person for a party'.\n3. **Search for Entertainment Costs**:\n- Query: 'average cost of entertainment for a birthday party' (this can include DJs, live bands, magicians, etc.).\n4. **Search for Decoration Costs**:\n- Query: 'average cost of decorations for a birthday party'.\n5. **Contingency Fund**:\n- Typically, this is a percentage of the total budget. We can assume around 10-15% of the total cost. Once we have the other costs, we can use the Calculator tool to calculate this.\n\nHere are the search queries formatted for the tool:\n\n<search> average cost of renting a party venue in [your city/area] </search>\n<search> average catering cost for a birthday party </search>\n<search> average cost of entertainment for a birthday party </search>\n<search> average cost of decorations for a birthday party </search>\n\nAfter we get the average costs from these searches, we can sum them up and calculate the contingency fund using the Calculator tool. For example, if the sum of costs is $2000, the contingency fund calculation would be:\n\n<calculator> 2000 | * | 0.1 </calculator>\n\nThis will give us 10% of the total as a contingency fund. Once all the costs are estimated, we can compile them into a complete budget.",

There are other ways of solving a quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as completing the square.\n\nGiven a general quadratic equation of the form\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) | \n\nNone\n\n</result>\n\nFinalize the answer based on this formula and create a plot to visualize the cylinder and explain the calculation.",
        "reference_answer": "To finalize the answer for the volume of the cylinder and to create a visualization, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder**:\n- The correct formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), as indicated in the search result.\n- For a cylinder with a height (h) of 10 inches and a base radius (r) of 3 inches, the volume calculation will be \\( V = \\pi \times 3^2 \times 10 \\).\n- This calculation can be performed using the Calculator tool.\n\nHere's the calculator tool command:\n\n<calculator> 3.14159 | * | 3 | * | 3 | * | 10 </calculator>\n\n2. **Visualize the Cylinder with a Python Plot**:\n- To visualize the cylinder, we will use Python to create a 3D plot that represents its dimensions.\n- This visualization will help in understanding the physical shape and size of the cylinder based on the given dimensions.\n\nHere's an example of the Python code for the visualization:\n\n<python>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport numpy as np\n\nheight = 10\nradius = 3\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nx = np.linspace(-radius, radius, 100)\nz = np.linspace(0, height, 100)\nX, Z = np.meshgrid(x, z)\nY = np.sqrt(radius**2 - X**2)\n\nax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, alpha=0.3, color='blue')\nax.plot_surface(X, -Y, Z, alpha=0.3, color='blue')\n\nax.set_xlabel('X axis')\nax.set_ylabel('Y axis')\nax.set_zlabel('Z axis')\nax.set_title('3D plot of a Cylinder')\n\nplt.show()\n\n</python>\n\n\nThis Python script will generate a 3D representation of the cylinder, showing its height and radius as per the problem's specifications.

If not, you will be returned the system error of the code such as: '<error> {error of python program} </error>'.\n\nInstead of trying to guess the result of the search, calculation, and python execution yourself, assume that there is a set of external tools. In other words, your role is to ONLY generate the argument that will be passed to the tools. ALWAYS follow the specified format, or else, you will fail to call the existing tools. Generate the thought process together.\n\nHere is the instruction you should follow:\n\nEvaluate the global progress in reducing carbon emissions over the past decade. Focus on the top five carbon-emitting countries. Gather recent statistics on their emission levels and initiatives taken to reduce them. Use Python to compare changes over time and deduce which country has made the most significant improvement.",
        "reference_answer": "To evaluate global progress in reducing carbon emissions over the past decade, focusing on the top five carbon-emitting countries, we need to first gather the most recent statistics on their emission levels and initiatives aimed at reduction. Here's how we proceed:\n\n1. **Gathering Data on Carbon Emissions**:\n- For each of the top five emitting countries, I will use the Search Engine tool to find recent data on their carbon emission levels and the steps taken to reduce them.\n\n<search> recent carbon emission statistics [Country Name] </search>\n<search> carbon reduction initiatives [Country Name] </search>\n\n2. **Comparing Changes Over Time**:\n- With this data, I will use the Python Executor to analyze the changes in emission levels over the past decade for these countries and visualize which country has made the most significant improvement.\n\nExample Python script:\n\n<python>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming data on emissions and initiatives has been formed into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Country': ['Country 1', 'Country 2', 'Country 3', 'Country 4', 'Country 5'],\n                   'Emission Reduction (%)': [15, 20, 25, 10, 5],\n                   'Year': [2010, 2015, 2020]})\ngroups = df.groupby('Country')\nfor name, group in groups:\n    plt.plot(group['Year'], group['Emission Reduction (%)'], marker='o', linestyle='-', label=name)\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Emission Reduction (%)')\nplt.title('Emission Reductions Over the Past Decade by Country')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n</python>\n\nThis approach allows us to not only track the global progress in reducing carbon emissions but also to identify which of the top-emitting countries has demonstrated the most significant improvements based on hard data and documented initiatives.",
