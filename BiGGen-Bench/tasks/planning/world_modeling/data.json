In the Wetlands, there are reports of declining amphibian populations, the Forests are experiencing reduced canopy cover due to invasive species, and the Grasslands are stable but under threat from neighboring agricultural runoff. The reserve plans to introduce predatory fish to control invasive amphibians, implement a tree-planting program in the Forests, and construct a natural filtration barrier around the Grasslands.\n\nActions:\n1. Introduce predatory fish in the Wetlands to control the population of invasive amphibians.\n2. Start a tree-planting initiative in the Forests focusing on native species to restore canopy cover.\n3. Construct a natural filtration barrier using local vegetation around the Grasslands to minimize agricultural runoff impact.",
