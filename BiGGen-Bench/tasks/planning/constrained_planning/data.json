        "reference_answer": "The strategy for improving urban air quality should include:\n\n1. Implementing strict regulations to control emissions from industrial sites and vehicles, including the transition to cleaner fuels and technologies.\n2. Developing and expanding urban green spaces such as parks, green roofs, and green belts to act as natural air filters, enhancing air quality and providing recreational areas for residents.\n3. Deploying an advanced network of air quality sensors across the city for real-time monitoring and management, facilitating quick responses to pollution hotspots.\n4. Promoting sustainable transportation options like electric public transit, bicycle-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly zones to reduce reliance on fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.\n5. Launching community awareness campaigns to educate residents on air quality issues and encourage individual actions that contribute to air quality improvements, such as using eco-friendly household products.\n6. Exploring the installation of innovative air purification technologies in areas with consistently poor air quality, providing immediate relief and demonstrating a commitment to health and sustainability.\n\nThis comprehensive approach targets the primary sources of air pollution, leverages technology for effective management, and fosters community engagement, ensuring a sustained improvement in urban air quality.",
